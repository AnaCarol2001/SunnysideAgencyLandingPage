## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology


### What I learned

For this project, the main goal was to apply the basic concepts to strengthen my fundamental knowledge of HTML and CSS. To add a challenge,  I learned about one of the CSS methodologies called BEM for naming the HTML elements and organizing the CSS file.

```css
/*BEM*/
.block{}
.block__element{}
.block--modifier{}
```

### Continued development

While developing this project, I noticed a need to learn more about web accessibility, so I will focus my future studies and projects on building more accessible applications. Additionally, finding out about BEM methodology was great since it made naming  HTML elements easier and CSS styles better structured, so I will keep using it.
